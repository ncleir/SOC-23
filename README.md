# SOC-23

Hackathon 1 attempted:
* Reshaped the data to make it fit for model input
* Used RelU actiavtion function. Tried to inorporate W2 in Loss function but couldn't think of any successful ideas.
* Further divided the given training dataset into train and test because the given test dataset doesn't have survival values.
* To run on the given test file, you just need to make sure that the test file is of same format as training file. My program prints the prediction accuracy of test dataset.
* I took 100 entries of training dataset and made them into test dataset. The accuracy is around 82%.
* I couldn't complete 2nd part.
